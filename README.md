# Capstone Project

The dataset that will be worked on is the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition supplied by UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition+

# Current Tentative Stages of Work:

## 1. Descriptive Statistics, Simple Exploration and Data Cleaning
 - Descriptive Statistics of all features for a general insight of the dataset
 - Exploring null values and duplicates and removing them.
 - Exploring Outliers (univariate & bivariate) and removing them if needed (quantitative)
## 2. Deep Data Exploration and Preperation for Cluster Analysis
 - Exploring correlation of all quantitative features
 - Create BMI feature based on formula and compare to class label for accuracy.
 - Exploring misrepresentation in features that contain categories
 - Graphing Height vs. Weight scatterplot to prepare for Clustering  
## Completing the Cluster Analysis

## Comparing original Class Label and Clustering to measure Performance

## Data Preparation for Supervised Learning

## Model Building for Random Forest to predict Obesity Level

## Performance Measures for Random Forest

## Conclusion
